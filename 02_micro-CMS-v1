we find ourselves at a website where each page is made from markdown

FLAG 1 
1) notice that the URL in the address bar corresponds to if we are editing or reading the page
2) there are pages /page/1, /page/2, and when we create a new page, /page/8
3) try the numbers in between these
4) /page/5 shows FORBIDDEN
5) /edit/page/5 shows the flag

FLAG 2
1) we see that we can't achieve XSS by writing `<script>alert("Hi");</script>` in the body of the input field bc in the HTML it is replaced by "scrubbed"
2) so instead we can put `<div onclick="alert('hi')">Click me</div>`. when we submit this as the form and click the text, it shows an alert.
3) check the page source to see the flag is now present within the div tag

FLAG 3
1) check for SQL injection by adding a single quote ' at the end of the URL /page/edit/1'
2) I had to look up this answer bc I had tested it but with /page/1' which did not yield the flag

FLAG 4
this one I also had to look up bc it was a stored XSS and I didn't notice the alert happening!
1) edit the title in CREATE PAGE and put in `<script>alert("hello");</script>`
2) the stored XSS vuln is reflected only when you click away and go back to the home page, when the title is displayed on the home page!
